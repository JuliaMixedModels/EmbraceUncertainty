"[Open science] refers to efforts by researchers, governments, research funding agencies or the scientific community itself to make the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in digital format with no or minimal restriction as a means for accelerating research; these efforts are in the interest of enhancing transparency and collaboration, and fostering innovation."

"An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. 
The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.

“The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data”

"One important idea is that science is a means whereby learning is achieved, not by mere theoretical speculation on the one hand, nor by the undirected accumulation of practical factson the other, but rather by a motivated iteration betmeen theory and practice...."

"The good scientist must have the flexibility and courage to seek out, recognize, and exploit ... errors-especially his own. 
In particular, using Bacon's analogy, he must not be like Pygmalion and fall in love with his model."


„Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct" one by excessive elaboration. 
On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. 
Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity.“  

"Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. 
It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad."

 "[T]he statistician knows, for example, that in nature there never was a normal distribution, there never was a straight line, yet with normal and linear assumptions, known to be false, he can often derive results which match, to a useful approximation, those found in the real world.

"The hallmark of empirical progress is not trivial verification. ... 
It is no success for Newtonian theory that stones, when dropped, fall towards the earth, no matter how often this is repeated. But so-called ‘refutations’ are not the hallmark of empirical failure, as Popper has preached, since all programmes grow in a permanent ocean of anomalies. 
What really counts are dramatic, unexpected stunning predictions: a few of them are enough to tilt the balance..."

"For the future, so far as we can see it, it appears to be unquestionable that the activity of the human race will provide the major factor in the environment of almost every evolving organism. 
Whether they act consciously or unconsciously human initiative and human choice have become the major channels of creative activity on this planet. 
Inadequately prepared we unquestionably are for the new responsibilities, which with the rapid extension of human control over the productive resources of the world have been, as it were, suddenly thrust upon us."

"There is nothing so practical as a good theory."
- Kurt Lewin (1943)

"To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. 
He can perhaps say what the experiment died of."
- Ronald Fisher (1938). First Session of the Indian Statistical Conference, Calcutta.
